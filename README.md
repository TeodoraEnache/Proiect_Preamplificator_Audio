## Project Overview
 The preamplifier is a crucial component of audio signal processing, enhancing low-level signals from sources such as microphones or pickups to levels that are suitable for further processing or amplification.The design's key feature is its voltage-controlled gain, which allows for precise adjustments to the amplification factor.  
 Adaptability is essential for ensuring audio fidelity in different input signal levels.

 ## Technical Details  
 Design Specifications: The preamplifier offers a gain range from 4x to 40x
 ## Circuit Simulation and Testing
 
 The circuit schematic consists of a Darlington amplifier stage, which provides high current gain and high input impedance, making it suitable for low-power signal amplification. The circuit operates with a single positive power supply, using a common ground reference. After amplification and filtering, the processed audio signal is directed to the output stage, ensuring high-quality signal transmission.

 The result of the PSpice simulation demonstrate how the gain varies with the control voltage.

 ### First Simulation - Control voltage=4V
 The gain is low, when the control voltage is 4V. The output signal(GREEN) is weak, having almost the same amplitude as the imput signal (RED), indicating that the circuit functions as a signal repeater.

### Second Simulation - Control voltage=0V
The gain increases, when the control voltage is 0V. The output(GREEN) is amplified significantly, with the output amplitude increased by a factor of 40.
