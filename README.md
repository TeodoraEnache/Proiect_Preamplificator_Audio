## Project Overview
 The preamplifier is a crucial component of audio signal processing, enhancing low-level signals from sources such as microphones or pickups to levels that are suitable for further processing or amplification.The design's key feature is its voltage-controlled gain, which allows for precise adjustments to the amplification factor.  
 Adaptability is essential for ensuring audio fidelity in different input signal levels.

 ## Technical Details  
 Design Specifications: The preamplifier offers a gain range from 4x to 40x
 ## Circuit Simulation and Testing
 
 The circuit schematic consists of a Darlington amplifier stage, which provides high current gain and high input impedance, making it suitable for low-power signal amplification. The circuit operates with a single positive power supply, using a common ground reference. After amplification and filtering, the processed audio signal is directed to the output stage, ensuring high-quality signal transmission.
